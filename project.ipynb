Since we do not have access to future events and statements made by individuals, it is impossible to provide a detailed explanation of what Andie Sobrato might say about platform slip-ons in 2023. It is important to note that any information or predictions about the future should be taken with caution, as it is subject to change and uncertainty."

      "In a diplomatic turn, designers have extended the lifespan of some noteworthy A/W 22 trends, continuing their exploration of them in 2023, ensuring we get adequate wear out of the pieces in which we've already invested. Elevated basics is one such trend. Last season, there was a clear '90s directive when it came to minimalism, with logo vests, low-slung trousers and tube dresses being hero items. Now, things have been pared back even further; sure, Y2K maxi skirts and oversized suiting are very much a thing, as witnessed on the runways of Peter Do and Roksanda respectively, but the silhouettes are cleaner and the colour palette looks more expensive; think shades of teal, camel and navy.\n",

      "\"We saw a complete shift away from the high-octane glamour that has dominated the space for the past few seasons to a more understated approach that embraces nudity in a subtle and chic way, which was a consistent theme throughout the shows. We have seen customers’ appetite for this mood during Fashion Month, with searches for 'sheer tops' increasing by 600% compared to the previous month. Saint Laurent owned this trend by showing 10 revealing dresses on the runway, and Valentino paired nude bodysuits with bright pop colours. We also saw a 400% increase in searches for transparent heels during Fashion Month and have heavily backed this moment by investing in 18 see-through styles for the upcoming season,\" says Page. \n",

      "I get it. Some of the trends on this list might not translate seamlessly into everyday life (if you're prepared to wear a completely sheer skirt to run errands in, more power to you). However, if you're looking to invest in something you'll genuinely get the wear of, look no further. Between wide-legs and puddle hemlines, slouchy-fit trousers were one of the biggest trends of 2022. Now, for spring 2023, the best jeans will feature these same design traits. From high-waisted dark-wash flares at Tibi to Bally's effortless double-denim moment complete with floor-grazing lengths, looser-fit denim is resolutely where it's at.\n",

But there is also another side to this creative coin; I've noticed an air of bohemia for smudgy surface patterns, with some designers combining lighter-weight, billowing fabrics alongside painterly ombrés to great effect. It's very 'I work in the arts, darling.'\" \n",

Formerly reserved for brides or the red carpet, trains are big news for spring/summer thanks to designers like Bally and Victoria Beckham, who showcased everything from minis to maxis with cascading details. Choose an ice-cream shade (I was particularly taken with the pistachio at ACNE and soft orange sorbet at Giambattista Valli) and a slinky material for maximum impact before adding polished accessories. I can't wait to dip my toe into this trend ahead of wedding season and will be choosing a style with an interesting neckline to keep things on the contemporary side,\" says Poppy Nash, managing editor at Who What Wear UK.\n",
